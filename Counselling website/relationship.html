            <p>Having a mental illness shouldn't keep you from enjoying fulfilling relationships of all kinds, from close friendships to romantic relationships and even marriage. Mental illness is fairly common. In reality, there are many people with mental health conditions in loving and nurturing relationships who share their lives with their partners, often raising families with them. Romantic relationships can be enriching, delightful and meaningful, but negotiating the ups and downs of such relationships can also be a major challenge, especially for those with a mental illness.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>No relationship, no matter how loving, is problem-free. One partner may have a poor credit score, making it hard to find a place to live or lease a car; the other might work the night shift, making it difficult to schedule events during normal times; and couples who appear to get along perfectly may have disagreements over the smallest matters. Despite the difficulties that can occur in a relationship when one or both partners have a mental illness, relationships can thrive when both partners learn how to communicate and compromise. </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Each partner brings many things, both strengths and limitations, to their relationships. Living with a mental illness may be your particular challenge. You are wise to be concerned in advance how you might affect your partner, but it is important to realize that hard times are a part of all relationships. Partners who care for each other can grow from facing difficulty.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Whether or not you are ready to enter a relationship largely depends on you. While it is true that many people harbor prejudices - a 2004 study showed that while 71% of people would be friends with someone with a mental illness, only 12.8% would be willing to marry.1 Yet, as long as you are taking good care of yourself and are willing to nurture another person, you have a good chance of finding a loving partner and developing a successful relationship. You must keep in mind, however, that relationships are two-way streets, and you will have to be prepared to take on the responsibility of having a significant other in your life. Their emotional needs must be considered as well as your own. The more active you are in managing your condition and caring for your health, the easier it may be for you to maintain a relationship.</p>
